# VISU

So, we can not update styled components, because the new version has problems with RMWC. This problem would be fixed in the new RMWC, but upgrading RMWC has then a new issue with styled components. Most probably styled components has an issue there. Further investiagtion needed.

### Planing
- Display 2D boxes (for detection algo, in normalized coords)
- How to add this "debug" data the best way?
